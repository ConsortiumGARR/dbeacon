<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<ul class="qgroup">

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">What does 'dbeacon' mean?</span>
	<p>
	'dbeacon' stands for Distributed Beacon. This named was adopted since
	it doesn't require a centralized server.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Why should i run 'dbeacon'?</span>
	<p>
	'dbeacon' might be useful if you are deploying intra or inter-domain multicast
	in your network. It is a tool that might help you find connectivity problems
	as well as to collect statistics about the current connectivity.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Why doesn't dbeacon use RTP/RTCP?</span>
	<p>
	Historically, dbeacon was designed to be compatible with the DAST/NLANR
	java beacon version which doesn't use RTP/RTCP. After dropping down the
	compatibility we considered implementing RTCP to gather various
	multicast figures because it would have been possible to plug dbeacon
	to any RTP/RTCP application.  Finally we decided that dbeacon was a
	specialized application and to implement additional features such as
	using SSM would require a new protocol.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">What is ASM? and SSM?</span>
	<p>
	ASM and SSM are two multicast models. ASM stands for Any Source
	Multicast while SSM for Source Specific Multicast. ASM provides
	a simple bidirectional multicast model for hosts at the expense of
	router complexity while SSM is a simpler unidirectional model.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Do i need to be 'root' to run dbeacon?</span>
	<p>
	No, dbeacon is able (and should be) run as a simple user.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Can i deploy several dbeacons in the same host?</span>
	<p>
	Yes, you may run as many dbeacons as your OS has resources for. A
	dbeacon is identified by a tuple (source address/source port), and
	multiple dbeacons running on the same machine are differenciated by
	their source port.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Where should i deploy dbeacon in my network?</span>
	<p>
	The rule is simple: wherever you want to check your multicast
	connectivity status. If you have 5 multicast enabled subnetworks it
	makes sense to deploy a dbeacon on each subnetwork.  Also, be carefull
	of IGMP/MLD snooping issues: you may encounter multicast problems with
	IGMP/MLD snooping and in those cases should deploy a dbeacon on each
	switched segment of your network.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">How can i make my flag show up in the matrix page?</span>
	<p>
	To make your flag show up in the matrix page, specify your Two Letter Country
	Code when running dbeacon. For instance:
	</p>
	<p>
	<code class="block">./dbeacon [...] -C EU</code>
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">I read the usage of 'ntpd' is recommended, why is that?</span>
	<p>
	'dbeacon' relies on the several beacon hosts to have their clocks properly
	synchronized in order to collect good delay statistics. 'ntpd' provides this
	feature.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">How do i setup the history feature?</span>
	<p>
	The history feature depends on the RRDs (Round Robin Database) perl
	module. So before setting it up you must be sure have this module
	available (if you are running Debian you may install
	<code>librrds-perl</code>, if not you may install it from rrdtool's
	source code.
	</p>
	<p>
	After RRDs is installed, set $history_enabled to 1 in your
	<code>matrix.conf</code> and either run matrix.pl periodicly via
	dbeacon, using the parameters <code>-I 60 -L contrib/matrix.pl</code>
	or from cron.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">How much disk space is required for the history feature?</span>
	<p>
	The History feature may take a lot of disk space, depending of the
	number of sources you are storing data for. The current implementation
	takes approximatively 30Mb per tuple (source, destination), so beware
	that for 10 sources it would take 300Mb of disk space. This space
	however is constant and doesn't increase with time due to the nature of
	the Round Robin Database.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">May i run a matrix page without history support?</span>
	<p>
	Yes, the history feature may be disabled via <code>matrix.conf</code>.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<a name="nosources" />
	<span class="question">My beacon is in the '<i>Beacons that report no
	received sources</i>' list.  What does it mean and how can i fix it?</span>
	<p>
	This means that while some (or all) beacons are able to receive your
	multicast packets, your beacon isn't receiving any other sources. This
	is due to a broken multicast setup, the current dbeacon relies on ASM
	for source discovery and it might be broken in your network. You should
	investigate your routers for problems (connectivity or configuration)
	or contact your network administrator.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">How much bandwidth will dbeacon consume?</span>
	<p>
	It depends on the current number of beacons in the group. Due to
	adaptive intervals 'dbeacon' usually consumes bandwidth in a direct
	proportion to the number of beacons. For instance, for 14 beacons, it
	usualy consumes around 10Kb/s if SSM is being used.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Is IPv4 supported?</span>
	<p>
	Yes, for ASM and SSM.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Is my Operating System supported?</span>
	<p>
	It depends on what Operating System you run. At this moment dbeacon is
	known to work in the following systems:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Linux 2.4 and 2.6, with SSM support in versions &gt;=
		2.6.11.</li>
		<li>BSD variants (you need the latest KAME kit to
		support SSM).</li>
		<li>Solaris (no SSM support)</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Where can i find a dbeacon Debian package?</span>
	<p>
	Check <a href="http://fivebits.net/proj/dbeacon/">dbeacon's website</a>.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">What debian packages do i need to install in order to setup a matrix?</span>
	<p>
	Besides a web server (such as <code>apache</code>) you need <code>perl</code> and
	<code>libxml-parser-perl</code>. If you wish to use the history feature you must also
	install <code>librrds-perl</code>.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">How do i setup my Apache to run a matrix page?</span>
	<p>
	Just add the following line to your apache configuration:
	</p>
	<p>
	<code class="block">ScriptAlias /matrix/ /path/to/matrix.pl</code>
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<a name="views" />
	<span class="question">What do 'TTL', 'Loss', 'Delay' and 'Jitter' in the matrix page mean?</span>
	<p>
	These are the various values gathered by the multicast beacon. The TTL
	is derived from the Time to live value (Hop count) of the packets and
	represents the number of multicast routers separating two specific
	sources.  The Loss represents the mean percentage of packet loss
	between two sources. The Delay is a distance between two sources but
	expressed in miliseconds, it represents the time for a packet to travel
	from one source to another. Jitter represents the additionnal
	interarrival time between each probe.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Why are some matrix cells painted in a lighter green than others?</span>
	<p>
	When in 'SSM or ASM' view (the default one), a bright green cell means that
	the currently displayed value was obtained via SSM, while a lighter green
	points to ASM only and a darker green to SSM only.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">How does dbeacon's protocol work?</span>
	<p>
	For a detailed explanation on dbeacon's protocol read the included PROTOCOL file.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">What does the sign '#' means in the source info
	listing ?</span>
	<p>
	This means that the source is ssmpingable : you can ssmping it with the
	ssmping tool from <a href="http://www.venaas.no/multicast/ssmping/">
	http://www.venaas.no/multicast/ssmping/ </a>. To announce to others
	beacons that you are ssmpingabe, use the option -F ssmping.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">I didn't found a response in the FAQ, what should I do?</span>
	<p>
	Either join <code>#m6bone</code> in the <code>irc.freenode.net</code>
	network or mail one of the developers.
	</p>
</li>

<li class="qst">
	<span class="question">Where can i find more information about multicast?</span>
	<p>
	You may find information about the IPv6 Multicast Backbone in
	<a href="http://www.m6bone.net">www.m6bone.net</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionaly Marco d'Itri was kind enough to supply a list of documents with
	lots of multicast information, from architecture to Cisco's configuration.
