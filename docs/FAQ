Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

These are some of the Frequently Asked Questions.

* What does 'dbeacon' mean?

  'dbeacon' stands for Distributed Beacon. It is named like this because it
  requires no central server to function.

- Why should i run 'dbeacon'?

  You should run 'dbeacon' if you are deploying intra or inter-domain multicast
  in your network. It is a tool that might help you find connectivity problems
  as well as to collect statistics about the current connectivity.

- I googled and found another beacon at NLAR, how does dbeacon differ from it?

- Why isn't dbeacon using RTP/RTCP?

- What is ASM? and SSM?

  ASM and SSM are two different multicast models. ASM stands for Any Source
  Multicast while SSM stands for Source Specific Multicast. ASM provides a
  simple bidirectional multicast model for hosts at the expense of router
  complexity while SSM is a simpler unidirectional model.

- Do i need to be 'root' to run dbeacon?

  No, dbeacon is able (and should be) run as a simple user.

- Can i deploy several dbeacons in the same host?

  Yes, you may run as many dbeacons as your OS has resources for.

- Where should i deploy dbeacon in my network?

- How can i make my flag to show up in the matrix page?

  To make your flag show up in the matrix page, specify your Two Letter Country
  Code when running dbeacon. For instance:

    ./dbeacon [...] -C EU

- I read the usage of 'ntpd' is recommended, why is that?

  'dbeacon' relies on the several beacon hosts to have their clocks properly
  synchronized in order to collect good delay statistics. 'ntpd' provides this
  feature.

- How do i setup the history feature?

- How much disk space is required for the history feature?

- May i run a matrix page without history support?

  Yes, the history feature may be disabled via matrix.conf.

- My beacon is in the 'Beacons that report no received sources' list.
  What does it mean and how can i fix it?

  This means that while some (or all) beacons are able to receive your multicast
  packets, you weren't. This is due to a broken multicast setup, you should
  investigate your routers for problems or contact your network administrator.

- How much bandwidth will dbeacon consume?

  It depends on the current number of beacons in the group. Due to adaptive
  intervals 'dbeacon' usually consumes bandwidth in a direct proportion of the
  number of beacons. So if there are currently 14 beacons, it should consume
  around 14Kb/s in average (a more real number would be 10-12Kb/s).

- Is IPv4 supported?

  Yes, for ASM and SSM.

- Is my Operating System supported?

  It depends on what Operating System you run. At this moment dbeacon is
  supported in Linux 2.4 and 2.6, with SSM support in versions >= 2.6.11.
  BSD variants are also supported, although for only ASM if don't have the
  latest KAME stack.

- Where can i find a dbeacon Debian package?

  Check dbeacon's website.

- I run Debian, what packages do i need to install in order to setup a matrix?

  Besides a web server (such as 'apache') you need 'perl' and
  'libxml-parser-perl'. If you wish to use the history feature you must also
  install 'librrds-perl'.

- How do i setup my Apache to run a matrix page?

  Just add the following line to your apache configuration:

    ScriptAlias /matrix/ /path/to/matrix.pl

- What do 'TTL', 'Loss', 'Delay' and 'Jitter' in the matrix page mean?

- Why are some matrix cells painted in a lighter green than others?

  When in 'SSM or ASM' view (the default one), a bright green cell means that
  the currently displayed value was obtained via SSM, while a lighter green
  points to ASM.

- How does dbeacon's protocol work?

  For a detailed explanation on dbeacon's protocol read the included PROTOCOL file.

- I didn't found a response in the FAQ, what should I do?

  Either join #m6bone in the irc.freenode.net network or mail one of the developers.

- Where can i find more information about multicast?

  You may find information about the IPv6 Multicast Backbone in www.m6bone.net.

  Additionaly Marco d'Itri was kind enough to supply a list of documents with
  lots of multicast information, from architecture to Cisco's configuration.
