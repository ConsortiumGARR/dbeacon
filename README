dbeacon - distributed beacon
----------------------------

A IPv6 Multicast Beacon. Useful for testing connectivity with other multicast
nodes. Original project from NLANR. Improved by little green men from mars.
Also implements the protocol used by the java beacon originally used in the m6bone.

  -b BEACON_ADDR/PORT    Multicast group address to send probes to
  -r REDIST_ADDR/PORT    Redistribute reports to the supplied host/port. Multiple may be supplied
  -M REDIST_ADDR/PORT    Redistribute and listen for reports in multicast addr
  -d                     Dump reports to xml each 5 secs
  -D FILE                Specifies dump file (default is dump.xml)
  -l LOCAL_ADDR/PORT     Listen for reports from other probes
  -L REPORT_ADDR/PORT    Listen to reports from other probs in multicast group REPORT_ADDR
  -P                     Use new protocol
