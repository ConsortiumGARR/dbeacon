dbeacon, a Multicast Beacon
---------------------------

dbeacon is a Multicast Beacon written in C++. The main purpose of a beacon is
to monitor other beacon's reachability and collect statistics such as loss,
delay and jitter between beacons. dbeacon supports both IPv4 and IPv6
multicast, collecting information via ASM and SSM.

dbeacon was originally only IPv6 capable, designed to be used in the m6bone.

Running
-------

Usage: dbeacon [OPTIONS...]

  -n NAME                Specifies the beacon name
  -a MAIL                Supply administration contact
  -i INTFNAME            Use INTFNAME instead of the default interface for multicast
  -b BEACON_ADDR[/PORT]  Multicast group address to send probes to
  -r REDIST_ADDR[/PORT]  Redistribute reports to the supplied host/port. Multiple may be supplied
  -S [GROUP_ADDR[/PORT]] Enables SSM reception/sending on optional GROUP_ADDR/PORT
  -s ADDR                Bind to local address
  -d [FILE]              Dump periodic reports to dump.xml or specified file
  -I NUMBER              Interval between dumps. Defaults to 5 secs
  -l LOCAL_ADDR[/PORT]   Listen for reports from other probes
  -W type$url            Specify a website to announce. type is one of lg, matrix
  -C CC                  Specify your two letter Country Code
  -L program             Launch program after each dump. The first argument will be the dump filename
  -4                     Force IPv4 usage
  -6                     Force IPv6 usage
  -v                     be verbose (use several for more verbosity)
  -U                     Dump periodic bandwidth usage reports to stdout
  -V                     Outputs version information and leaves

To join our experimental deployment in the m6bone use:

	./dbeacon -a YOURMAIL -n SITENAME -b ff1e::1:f00d:beac -S

Only use -S if are running Linux >= 2.6.11. There were some problems with SSM in earlier versions.

If you are interested in running the matrix script also use -d so dbeacon exports statistic information to dump.xml.

A more complete command line would be

	./dbeacon -a MAIL -n NAME -b ff1e::1:f00d:beac -S -W http://yoursite.com -W matrix\$http://yoursite.com/matrix/ -d
