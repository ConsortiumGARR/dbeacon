TODO
----

- add dynamic SSM (-S GROUP/PORT param)
   -> for each source in the ASM group, join (S, GROUP) to receive
      also add GROUP to local redistribute list.
      aggregate results in table instead of two entries asm/ssm
- do debian packages!
- a nice web frontend to generate a matrix, and other stuff
- better measurer code. the current code is similiar to the java beacon one, which sucks
  maybe use a small round-robin db/table, or a mean-tree.
- clearly separate java-beacon protocol stuff so it can easily be wiped out in the future
- be friendly to people
